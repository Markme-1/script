Hey there!


these scripts I created in my free time some of them are useful and some of them are just useless:)
1. down.sh: automate my shutdown process(tested in kali linux)
2. up.sh  : Run simple python web server on port 8000 (tested in kali linux)
3. wios.sh: wifi DOS tool using aircrsck suit (processing)
4. image.py: this python code can be used to resize(increase/decrease) images.
5. scan.py: a basic level port scanner using python
